    As per the UKVI , under the Graduate Immigration Route,Â  international students studying in the UK can apply for the Post Study Work Visa to stay and work in the UK for two years (three years for PhD students). With this visa, without a sponsor , Indian students can stay in the UK for much longer and can gain international work experience.
<br />
The graduates can apply to other routes once their PSW visa comes to an end such as the <strong>Skilled Worker</strong>, Global Talent and Innovator routes.Hence focusing on certain courses such as STEM courses and the professions listed in the Shortage Occupation List, will give the student an edge in getting settled in the UK.
